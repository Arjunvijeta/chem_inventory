## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/chem_inventory
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   ALGORITHM=HS256
   ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
   ```

5. Run database migrations:

   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

6. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

The backend server will run on `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:

   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The frontend application will run on `http://localhost:3000`

## API Documentation

- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

## Development

### Backend Development

- The backend follows a modular structure with separate routers for different functionalities
- Database models are defined in `models.py`
- API schemas are defined in `schemas.py`
- Authentication logic is handled in the `auth` directory

### Frontend Development

- The frontend is built using React with a component-based architecture
- Styling is done using Tailwind CSS
- Chemical structure visualization is implemented using Ketcher
- Routing is handled using React Router
